Python Homework Due 10.12.20

Hi All - 

Sorry for the delay. I've done the best I could catching up following a busy week out of town. PyPoll is complete but PyBank is only semi-functional. 
I'm going to get working on the next homework which is due 10/19 so I don't continue to fall behind. Let me know if there's anything more I need for a passing grade.
Thanks, 
Brett W
